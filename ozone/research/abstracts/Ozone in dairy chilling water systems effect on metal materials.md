## Highlights

- Pulsed ozone can be used as a disinfecting agent in chilling water systems
- Feasibility is dependent on whether components of the system are adversely affected
- Testing showed that pulsing ozone into water for 20 minutes per day over 7 days caused weight loss in various metals including aluminium, carbon steel, copper, and stainless steel samples
- Only weight loss for carbon steel was significantly greater than control samples
- Severe pitting was observed on ozone treated copper samples under scanning electron microscopy 
- Black striations were observed on ozone treated carbon steel surfaces

## Abstract

The use of pulsed ozone as a disinfecting agent in chilling water systems will be feasible only if components of the systems are not adversely affected. Pulsing ozone into water at room temperature for 20 minutes per day for 7 days caused greater weight loss of aluminium, carbon steel, copper, 304 stainless steel and 316 stainless steel samples than control samples; however, only weight loss for carbon steel was significantly greater (α= .05). Severe pitting was noted on ozone treated copper samples when observed by scanning electron microscopy. Black striations were observed on ozone treated carbon steel surfaces.

## Abstract ITA

L'uso dell'ozono impulso come agente disinfettante nei sistemi di raffreddamento a acqua sarà fattibile solo se i componenti dei sistemi non subiranno effetti negativi. L'immissione di ozono nell'acqua a temperatura ambiente per 20 minuti al giorno per 7 giorni ha causato una maggiore perdita di peso dei campioni di alluminio, acciaio al carbonio, rame, acciaio inossidabile 304 e acciaio inossidabile 316 rispetto ai campioni di controllo; tuttavia, solo la perdita di peso per l'acciaio al carbonio era significativamente maggiore (α = .05). Sono state osservate gravi cavità sui campioni di rame trattati con ozono quando osservati mediante microscopia elettronica a scansione. Sulle superfici dell'acciaio al carbonio trattato con ozono sono state osservate striature nere.

## Easier

Using pulsed ozone to clean water in cooling systems can be a good idea, but only if it doesn't damage the parts of the system. When they tested this method on different metals for seven days, they found that some metals lost weight and showed signs of damage from the ozone. Only carbon steel had significant damage though. Copper showed pitting and black lines appeared on carbon steel surfaces after treatment with ozone.

## Other Explanation

Greene et al. observed that 0.4–0.5 ppm of ozone, pulsed into water at 21–23 °C for
20 min per day over a 7-day period, caused a certain degree of weight loss of all materials
tested (i.e., aluminum, copper, stainless steel, and carbon steel), but only weight loss for
carbon steel was significant. Therefore, special attention is required when the treatment is
used for dairy chilling water systems with copper or carbon steel parts.
