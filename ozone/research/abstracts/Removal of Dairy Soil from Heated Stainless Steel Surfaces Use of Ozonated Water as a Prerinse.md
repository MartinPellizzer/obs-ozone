## Abstract

Square (2.54 x 2.54 cm2 ) 304 stainless steel metal plates were cleaned, passivated, and soiled by autoclaving (121°C at 15 psi for 15 min) with reconstituted nonfat dry milk (20% solids). Fifteen-minute treatments using either warm water (40°C) or ozonated cold water (10°C) were conducted to compare prerinse cleaning potential of soiled metal plate. The chemical oxygen demand determination was performed on extracted organic material from treated metal plates. Results indicated that the ozone treatment removed 84% of soil from metal plates versus 51% soil removal by the warm water treatment, but the effectiveness of the two treatments did not differ (P > 0.05). Cleaning effects were visualized using scanning electron microscopy at 200× and 2000× magnification. The amount of soil film present on stainless steel metal surfaces was visibly lower on ozonated treatments versus on warm water treatments. (Key words: ozone, sanitation, dairy, chemical oxygen demand) Abbreviation key: ddH2O = distilled and deionized water; COD = chemical oxygen demand.

## Highlights

- Square metal plates made of 304 stainless steel were cleaned, passivated, and soiled with nonfat dry milk.
- Warm water (40°C) and ozonated cold water (10°C) were used in a 15-minute treatment to compare their cleaning potential on the soiled metal plates.
- The ozone treatment removed 84% of soil from the metal plates while warm water removed only 51%.
- However, the effectiveness of both treatments did not differ significantly.
- Chemical oxygen demand determination was performed on extracted organic material from treated metal plates.
- Scanning electron microscopy showed that ozonated treatments had visibly lower amounts of soil film on stainless steel surfaces compared to warm water treatments.
- Key words include ozone, sanitation, dairy, chemical oxygen demand.

Le piastre metalliche in acciaio inossidabile 304 (2,54 x 2,54 cm²) sono state pulite, passivate e sporcate tramite autoclavaggio (121°C a 15 psi per 15 minuti) con latte scremato essiccato reidratato al 20% di solidi. Sono stati condotti trattamenti della durata di quindici minuti utilizzando acqua calda (40°C) o acqua fredda ozonizzata (10°C) per confrontare il potenziale di pre-risciacquo nella pulizia delle piastre metalliche sporche. La determinazione della domanda chimica di ossigeno è stata effettuata sui materiali organici estratti dalle piastre metalliche trattate. I risultati hanno indicato che il trattamento all'ozono ha rimosso l'84% dello sporco dalle piastre metalliche rispetto al solo 51% ottenuto dal trattamento con acqua calda; tuttavia non vi era differenza significativa tra i due metodi (P >0,05). Gli effetti sulla pulizia sono stati visualizzati attraverso la microscopia elettronica a scansione con ingrandimenti di 200x e 2000x. La quantità del film sporco presente sulle superfici in acciaio inossidabile era visibilmente inferiore nel caso dei trattamenti all'ozono rispetto ai soli risciacqui con acqua calda.

## Other Description

Guzel-Seydim et al. [88] evaluated the use of ozone for the treatment of stainless-steel
surfaces to remove milk residues, demonstrating its greater effectiveness compared to the
traditional treatment with hot water at 40 °C. 15 min treatments using either warm water
(40 °C) or ozonated cold water (10 °C) were conducted. The results show that Chemical
Oxygen Demand (C.O.D.) values are reduced by 84% (ozone treatment) against 51% (hot
water treatment). Furthermore, many researchers have evaluated the effectiveness of ozone
against microorganisms that can colonize metal surfaces.
