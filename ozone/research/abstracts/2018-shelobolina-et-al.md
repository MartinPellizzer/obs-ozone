## Abstract

The inactivation ofPseudomonas  aeruginosabiofilms grown on glass under high shear stress andexposed to a range of dissolved ozone concentrations (2, 5 and 7 ppm) at 10 and 20 min wasinvestigated. The regression equation, log reduction (biofilm)¼0.64þ0.59(C–2)þ0.33(T–10),described the dependence of biofilm inactivation on the dissolved ozone concentration (C, ppm)and contact time (T, min). The predicted D-values were 11.1, 5.7 and 2.2 min at 2, 5 and 7 ppm,respectively. Inactivation of biofilms grown on various surfaces was tested at a single dissolvedozone concentration of 5 ppm and a single exposure time of 20 min. Biofilms grown on plasticmaterials showed inactivation results similar to that of biofilms on glass, while biofilms grown onceramics were statistically significantly more difficult to inactivate, suggesting the importance of uti-lizing non-porous materials in industrial and clinical settings.

## Abstract ITA

È stata investigata l'inattivazione dei biofilm di Pseudomonas aeruginosa cresciuti su vetro sotto alto stress di taglio ed esposti a una gamma di concentrazioni di ozono disciolto (2, 5 e 7 ppm) per 10 e 20 minuti. L'equazione di regressione, riduzione logaritmica (biofilm) = 0,64 + 0,59 x (C-2) + 0,33 x (T-10), ha descritto la dipendenza dell'inattivazione del biofilm dalla concentrazione di ozono disciolto (C, ppm) e dal tempo di contatto (T, minuti). I valori D previsti erano di 11,1, 5,7 e 2,2 minuti a 2, 5 e 7 ppm, rispettivamente. È stata testata l'inattivazione di biofilm cresciuti su diverse superfici a una singola concentrazione di ozono disciolto di 5 ppm e un singolo tempo di esposizione di 20 minuti. I biofilm cresciuti su materiali

- Testing of inactivation on various surfaces at 5 ppm and 20 minutes exposure time
- Similar results for plastic and glass surfaces, but statistically significant difficulty in inactivating biofilms on ceramics
- Suggesting the importance of using non-porous materials in industrial and clinical settings.

## Other

Shelobolina et al. [95] studied the effect of dissolved ozone (5 ppm for 20 min) on
Pseudomonas biofilm on various surfaces, and they observed that ozone can be effective.
Biofilms on plastic materials showed inactivation effects, such as for glass, while biofilms
grown on ceramics were more difficult to inactivate. Therefore, it is important to use
non-porous materials in industrial and clinical settings. It has also been demonstrated that
ozone can have an antimicrobial effect in association with other technologies: for example,
ozone water and hydrogen peroxide solution were effective on P. fluorescens biofilm.
