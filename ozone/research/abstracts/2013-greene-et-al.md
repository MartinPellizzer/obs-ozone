## Highlights

1. Comparison of effectiveness between ozonated water and chlorinated sanitizer against biofilms of milk spoilage bacteria
2. Use of stainless steel plates incubated in UHT-pasteurized milk inoculated with pure cultures
3. Both ozonation and chlorination reduced bacteria populations by > 99%
4. Initial cell densities ranged from approximately 1.24 x 10(5) to 8.56 x 10(5) cfu/cm2 for Pseudomonas fluorescens, and 1.53 x 10(4) to 8.56 x 10(5) cfu/cm2 for Alcaligenes faecalis in milk films on stainless steel surfaces.
5. Results suggest that both ozonated water and commercial chlorinated sanitizers are effective at reducing bacterial populations in biofilms on stainless steel surfaces contaminated with milk spoilage bacteria like Pseudomonas fluorescens or Alcaligenes faecalis

## Abstract

Ozonated water and chlorinated sanitizer were compared for effectiveness against biofilms of milk spoilage bacteria. Stainless steel plates were incubated in UHT-pasteurized milk inoculated with pure cultures of either Pseudomonas fluorescens (ATCC 949) or Alcaligenes faecalis (ATCC 337). After incubation, the plates were removed and rinsed in sterile PBS. A control rinsed stainless steel plate was swabbed and plated on standard plate count agar. A second rinsed stainless steel plate was covered and treated for 2 min with a commercial chlorinated sanitizer (dichloro-s-triazinetrione), prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations; after treatment, the plate was rinsed twice in sterile PBS, swabbed, and plated on standard plate count agar. A third rinsed stainless steel plate from the culture was placed in ozonated deionized H2O (.5 ppm of ozone) for 10 min, rinsed twice as described, swabbed, and plated. Both ozonation and chlorination reduced bacteria populations by > 99% at initial cell densities in the range of approximately 1.24 x 10(5) to 8.56 x 10(5) cfu/cm2 for P. fluorescens and 1.53 x 10(4) to 8.56 x 10(5) cfu/cm2 for A. faecalis in milk films on stainless steel surfaces.

## Other Abstract

Greene et al. [89] studied the effect of ozonated deionized water against psychrophilic
contaminating microflora (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Alcaligenes faecalis) on stainless steel
plates, showing that a 10-min exposure with a concentration of 0.5 ppm decreased the
microbial growth by more than 4 log10. For the experimentation, stainless steel plates were
incubated in UHT pasteurized milk and inoculated with pure cultures of Pseudomonas
fluorescens (ATCC 949) or Alcaligenes faecalis (ATCC 337). Since these are metal surfaces,
the corrosive power of ozone must always be considered. The use of ozonated water is
recommended, instead of hot water and chlorine, when the surfaces of the milk processing
equipment are not damaged.
