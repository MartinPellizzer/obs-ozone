## Abstract

A pilot model of an ozone generator with a pulsed power supply has been developed. The ozone generator can be used for disinfection of domestic and industrial premises, in medicine and the chemical industry. Ozone is generated by a surface dielectric barrier discharge reactor (SDBD), consisting of 18 parallel-connected quartz tubes, inside and outside of which spiral the stainless steel high-voltage electrodes are wound. The measurements of the main parameters of the ozone generator showed that the ozone concentration reached 57 mg/l, and the output ozone concentration is 9.4 g/h. The developed design takes into account the technical features of the implementation of a particular type of discharge used, allows reducing energy consumption for ozone generation, having improved output parameters.
