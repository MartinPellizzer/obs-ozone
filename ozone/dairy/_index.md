| Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes were treated with ozonized water (0.5 ppm) by immersion in static condition, ozonized water under flow conditions, and gaseous ozone at different concentrations (0.1–20 ppm) (20–60 min) | Inactivation of foodborne bacteria biofilms by aqueous and gaseous ozone | Aqueous ozone under static conditions resulted in an estimated viability reduction of 1.61–2.14 Log CFU cm°2 after 20 min, while reduction values were higher (3.26–5.23 Log CFU cm°2) for biofilms treated in dynamic conditions.
