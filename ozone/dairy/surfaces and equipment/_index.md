## Ozone
- pros
- cons
	- corrosive on metal

## Materials
- stainless-steel

## Applications
- cleaning
- disinfection

## Problems
- remove milk residues
- pseudomonas fluorescens (ATCC 949)
- alcaligenes faecalis (ATCC 337)

## Other Methods
- hot water with chemicals
	-  large energy :(
	-  chemical consumption :(

## Studies
- Guzel-Seydim et al.
	- P: remove milk residues on stainless steel
	- T: ozone water 15 min at 10 °C - warm water 15 min at 40 °C
	- R: COD reduced by 84% - COD reduced by 51%
	- V: ozone wins
- Greene et al. 
	- P: pseudomonas fluorescens and alcaligenes faecalis on stainless steel plates
	- T: ozone water 10 min at 0.5 ppm
	- R: decrease microbial growth > 4log
	- V: ozone > hot water and chlorine

Recently, the potential of disinfection effectiveness of single
and synergistic ozone (10 ppm for 15 min) and UVC (1 cm or 15.56 mW cm􀀀2 for 15 min)
treatment for the sterilization of bacteria and fungi (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus,
Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus) was studied on different material surfaces
(stainless steel, polymethyl methacrylate, copper, surgical facemask, denim, and a cottonpolyester
fabric) [90].
