## Studies



Recently, the potential of disinfection effectiveness of single
and synergistic ozone (10 ppm for 15 min) and UVC (1 cm or 15.56 mW cm􀀀2 for 15 min)
treatment for the sterilization of bacteria and fungi (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus,
Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus) was studied on different material surfaces
(stainless steel, polymethyl methacrylate, copper, surgical facemask, denim, and a cottonpolyester
fabric) [90].
