## Studies

In a study of a cheese production plant, the gaseous ozonation of 2 ppm was provided
during a weekend for 15 min (first treatment) and for 120 min (second treatment), when
staff were not present. Testing for L. monocytogenes was carried out for a total of 360 environmental
samples, over a period of 12 months, in 15 areas before and 15 areas after ozonation:
there was a significant reduction in L. monocytogenes isolations from 15.0% in pre-zoning
samples to 1.67% in post-ozonation samples in all areas, to include the ozonation regime in
the hygiene-health program. No negative effects of ozonation treatment were noted on the
surfaces and equipment [97].
