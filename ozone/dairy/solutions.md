## Ozone

- The treatment of wastewater with ozone allows for the production of effluents at a level that can be discharged into natural aquatic systems
- Ozone is a viable alternative for sanitization concerning other traditional sanitizers, such as chlorine, for over-chemical residues and potential environmental impacts that consumers care about
- In this sense, the potential utility of ozone lies in the fact that ozone is a stronger oxidant compound than chlorine, and it has been shown to be effective over a wider spectrum of microorganisms.
- Furthermore, ozone reacts with some organic compounds in food matrices, and the possible by-products are aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids, which do not pose a threat to human health [39].
- Unlike other disinfectants, it leaves no ozone residue and degrades to molecular oxygen upon reaction or natural degradation [30] (figure 1).

## UHT

- ultra-high-temperature (UHT)-processed milk uses a lot of chemicals (alkaline cleaners, such as NaOH, and HNO3) for cleaning


The cleaning of equipment was once completely manual in the dairy sector, using brushes and detergent solutions, and it involved dismantling the equipment to access every surface. This approach was labor- and time-intensive and often quite counterproductive, since contamination can be reintroduced to the system by imperfectly cleaned equipment.
- These issues were solved by the introduction of CIP (Cleaning In Place) programs, which adopted automated cleaning systems in various parts of the processing plant to achieve the necessary cleaning and sanitation results [^19]. However, in sanitation systems, it is advisable to try to lower the environmental impact of the various operations.
- The microbiota, made up of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) [23], contributes significantly to the quality and safety of the final product, even to the nutritional composition [24], developing desirable characteristics and flavor compounds, and it inhibits the growth of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in cheese [25].
- Moreover, their variation leads to obtaining a different quality of the product and, for this reason, some studies were conducted to isolate microbial strains that were obtained from the best natural fermentations [26].
- Examples of starter LAB dominant:
	- during the fermentation period are:
		- Lactococcus and Streptococcus [25], 
	- during the maturation process the dominant species are:
		- Lactobacillus helveticus
		- Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei
		- Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis
		- Enterobacter faecium
		- Lactobacillus plantarum
	- qualitatively appreciated by consumers thanks to flavor intensity and texture, as well as overall acceptability [27–29].
- Since the inoculation of starter cultures has been shown by several studies to have a better impact on the overall quality of the cheese, there are commercial starter cultures with which to inoculate cheeses [26].
