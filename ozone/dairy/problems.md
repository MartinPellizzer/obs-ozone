## wastewater

- problems and costs for the disposal of wastewater, both for the sanitizers used, and for the production residues
- cost of disposal
- problems of disposal
- Dairy wastewater (DWW) contains high levels of mineral and organic compounds, which can collect in soil and water, affecting serious environmental pollution
- high organic content must be disposed
- by physical–chemical and biological methods


- The common practice for the sanitation of water is the use of chlorine gas (Cl2), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), or hypochlorite (ClO-) due to the bactericidal and oxidative properties of chlorine
- The amount of chlorine required for sanitization applications depends on the concentration in water of the species to be oxidized, organic substances, micro-organisms, ferrous ions and manganese, nitrites, and hydrogen sulfide
- However, in sanitation systems, it is advisable to try to lower the environmental impact of the various operations.
- Milk and dairy products offer highly nutritious food for microorganisms to multiply, so they can produce spoilage. The microbial contamination depends on the raw material quality, the conditions under which the products were produced, and the temperature and duration of their storage [20,21], resulting in product decay due to contamination by spoilage microorganisms, bringing the product to be unsaleable or greatly depreciated.
- In the case of pathogenic microorganisms, the product is not marketable, as it is harmful to human health.
- The control of contamination by spoilage bacteria, like Pseudomonas spp., and pathogenic bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella spp., is a big challenge for the dairy industry [22].
- The transport of bulk milk from the dairy to the processing plant is critical, as well as the various stages of storage and processing, because it could significantly alter the milk microbiota due to contamination or the growth of microflora [30–35].

## Mites

- Product losses also occur due to infestation problems, such as mites, which infest the ripening rooms through the wooden boards used to mature the cheeses, with consequences ranging from product weight loss to the waste of the entire cheese.
- The mites are very small, hardly visible to the naked eye, and are practically ubiquitous in the dairy industry and, more generally, in the food sectors in which a product maturation phase is foreseen [36].
- They are present in the wooden shelves used in the maturing rooms and spread through the clothes of the operators, or they can be transported by air; dirty environments favor their proliferation [36–38].
- Therefore, cleaning and disinfection are key operations for food safety, but they produce a high environmental impact due to water use and wastewater.
- In the care areas, chemicals such as chlorine, quaternary ammonium compounds, etc., are used.

Health and environmental concerns with chemical use on food products or food contact facilities are supporting the need for alternative sanitation technologies.
