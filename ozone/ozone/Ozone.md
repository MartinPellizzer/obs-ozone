- Ozonation is a clean technique with antimicrobial power due to its oxidation potential able to reduce the microorganisms, limiting the production of enzymes, but the effectiveness of ozone can be affected by the temperature, pH, humidity, and the amount of organic matter around the cells [41].
- The aim of this review is to give an overview of the current state of knowledge on several manufacturing and storage processes of the dairy chain, highlighting the potential and limiting the use of gaseous or ozonated water against the pathogenic and spoilage microflora, parasites, and insects, such as molds and mites. Specifically, we intend to start from the raw material of the dairy supply chain, the milk, up to the different final products, including their quality and sensory parameters, passing through the sanitization of the working surface areas and equipment and through the treatment of wastewater. The process flow diagram of the dairy industry is shown below.
